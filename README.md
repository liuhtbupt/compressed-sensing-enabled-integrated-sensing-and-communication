This project includes a pdf and two MATLAB files.
The pdf is a signal processing paper about compressed sensing enabled integrated sensing and communication within unlicensed spectrum bands, and you can also see that through the URL "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02555".
By the way, this paper has submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cognitive communication and Networking Journal.
The MATLAB file named "FISTA_Upgrade_R_mode1" is a simulate code about range profile.
The MAATLAB file named "FISTA_Upgrade_Traditional_RMSE_mode1" is a simulate code about the root mean square error (RMSE) for distance estimation of target.
